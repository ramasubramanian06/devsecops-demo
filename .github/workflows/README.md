2. **Static Code Analysis** - Performs linting with ESLint
3. **Build** - Creates a production build of the application
4. **Docker Image Creation** - Builds a Docker image using a multi-stage Dockerfile
5. **Docker Image Scan** - Scans the image for vulnerabilities using Trivy
6. **Docker Image Push** - Pushes the image to GitHub Container Registry
7. **Update Kubernetes Deployment** - Updates the Kubernetes deployment file with the new image tag
